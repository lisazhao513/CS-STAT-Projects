# Projects

## Spam or Ham Classification
* Developed a text classification model using logistic regression to identify spam emails based on keyword frequency and email length features.
* Performed feature engineering, including tokenization and length-based features, to improve classification accuracy.
* Achieved robust performance using a train-validation-test split approach, validated with confusion matrix and accuracy metrics.

## Predicting Housing Prices in Cook County
* Developed a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on multiple features, such as number of bedrooms, square footage, and location.
* Applied data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling for model readiness.
* Evaluated model performance using RMSE and cross-validation to assess generalization across different subsets of the data.
